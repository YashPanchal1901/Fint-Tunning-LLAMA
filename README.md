# 🦙 Fine-Tuned LLaMA Model (GGUF)

This repository contains my fine-tuned **LLaMA model** exported in **GGUF format**, along with the tokenizer files.  
The project demonstrates how to perform fine-tuning using **ORPO (Offline Reinforcement Preference Optimization)** and deploy the model efficiently with **GGUF** for inference using `llama.cpp` and other lightweight runtimes.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Base Model**: LLaMA (Meta AI)  
- **Fine-tuning Method**: ORPO (preference optimization for alignment)  
- **Model Format**: GGUF (quantized for efficiency)  
- **Tokenizer**: Included for compatibility with Hugging Face + llama.cpp  

This project was developed in a Kaggle Notebook environment for research and experimentation.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
````

### 2. Run inference with `llama.cpp`

```bash
./main -m model.gguf -p "What is ORPO fine-tuning?"
```

### 3. Use with Hugging Face `transformers` + `llama.cpp`

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./")

# Load GGUF model
llm = Llama(model_path="model.gguf")

output = llm("Explain fine-tuning in simple words.")
print(output)
```
